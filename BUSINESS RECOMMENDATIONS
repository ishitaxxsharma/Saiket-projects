# Business Recommendations (printed)

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Convert month-to-month customers to annual contracts
   Reason: They have highest churn rate.

2. Offer discounts to high-charges + short-tenure customers.
   Reason: These customers are high value but churn-prone.

3. Improve electronic check experience.
   Reason: Highest churn comes from this payment method.

4. Launch personalized retention campaigns for short-tenure customers.
   Reason: Low loyalty in first few months.

5. Provide loyalty benefits for long-tenure, low-churn customers.
   Reason: Helps increase lifetime value.
